## Overview

This is group 5's product for the third project in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive.  We had to create a web app using the MEAN stack and at least two models created with Mongoose.  We chose to create an application to help users organize parties. This involved three mongoose models (user, home, and food).

## Technologies Used

* **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* **MEAN Stack:** MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and NodeJS
* **UI Framework:** Angular-Material
* **ODM:** Mongoose
* **Security:** PassportJS, bcrypt-nodejs
* **Mockups:** Pen and Paper
* **Project Planning & User Stories:** - Trello
* **Text Editors:** - Atom and Sublime Text 3

## Features

* Coming soon!

## Build Process

### Mockups

We drew basic sketches of some of our views, but actually did most of our 'mockups' by creating static html pages in a mock-layout branch of our project. This gave us more control of creating our layouts and designs, and gave us actual code that we could take and implement in our project's final views and templates.
